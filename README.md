# CSE1110-processing-assignment-1
**Due: Tuesday October 18, 2016**

You will be using [Processing](https://processing.org/) for this assignment. Save your program on the F drive in your Computer Science folder. Use the online Processing reference (https://processing.org/reference/) to find information about how to use commands. Check off the items as you completed them (Check out [How to use task lists in markdown documents](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents)).

Your final program should produce an image like this. The colours do not have to be the same, but as long as you have followed all the instructions and changed the default values for colors.

## Step 1
- [ ] Begin with the following code:

```
// Set up canvas
void setup() {
  size(700, 500); // Size of canvas
  background(100, 10, 100); // Background color as rgb values
}

void draw() {
  // Your program will be here...
  
  // Do not forget comments!
}
```
## Step 2 
- [ ] Draw three equally sized rectangles across the screen
- [ ] Line them up evenly (same Y coordinates)
- [ ] Spread them out so they are equally spaced
